4 lectures [Linear FEA](https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse2019/blob/master/ArchiveFEA.zip)
Please read it carrefully in autonomy. Largely inspired by [Prof Haftka's course](https://mae.ufl.edu/haftka/course.html) 


## AUDIO

[Course 2](https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse/blob/master/Course2.md)

[Course 3](https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse/blob/master/Course3.md)

[Course 4](https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse/blob/master/Course4.md)

Have a look to the course exercice in the 2 repo
AssignementC1toC2
AssignementC3toC4

The slides of the different courses are available on *SUPAERO's LMS* with supplementary materials (video, Nastran), assignements (matlab) & projects (matlab, nastran, abaqus).

## Warning
I'm using a lot symbolic computation but in the scope of the course:
you'll need to do Gauss integration (exact integration for polynoms) because of the shape functions are ofthen 3rd order polynomial...

[Course 2](https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse/blob/master/C2_tutorial.md)

[Course 3](https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse/blob/master/C3_tutorial.md)


## MORE ADVANCED MATERIALS (BONUS)

Prof, can you help us to understand the plate modeling and bending behaviour?
Thanks to S. Coniglio phD !  [Plate2D_Bending](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse/blob/master/Plate2D_Bending/plate_el.html)
