# feacourse2018

This webpage contains **only** tutorials. Warning I'm using a lot symbolic computation but in the scope of the course:
you'll need to do Gauss integration (exact integration for polynoms) because of the shape functions are ofthen 3rd order polynomial...

The slides of the different courses are available on *SUPAERO's LMS*. 

1st MATLAB tutorial on [Shape functions](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse2018/blob/master/Shape_Functions/ShapeFunction.html)

Then How do we derive the K stiffness matrix for a rod?


2nd MATLAB tutorial on [2 nodes rod](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse2018/blob/master/K_derivation_Rod/K_derivation2_node.html)

But How do we derive the K stiffness matrix for a beam?


3rd MATLAB tutorial on [2 nodes beam](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse2018/blob/master/K_derivation_Beam/K_derivation_beam.html)

And probably the most important thing ...

4th MATLAB tutorial on [Equivalent forces for beam element](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jomorlier/feacourse2018/blob/master/Equivalent_Nodal_force/Equivalent_Nodal_force.html)
